# raylib-imgui-cmake-template
ðŸŽ¨ template repo for getting started with raylib together with imgui using cmake!

## Getting started

1. Click the green `Use this template` up to the right and choose a name for the new repository.
2. Clone down your new repository.
3. Download some [raylib binaries](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases) (only tested with raylib 3.5), precompiled static libraries.
4. Put the downloaded `libraylib.a` files into their respective folders in `libs/raylib-cpp/`. For Windows, you'll need `raylib-3.x.x_win64_mingw-w64.zip
`, and for MacOS you'll want `raylib-3.x.x_macos.tar.gz`.
5. Then it's just a matter of building the project using CMake.
